For this project we use more library like:-
1)Redux/react-redux-toolkit
2)React-Router-Dom
3)Appwrite
4)React-From
5)html-react-parser
6)@tinymce/tinymce-react
7)Tailwind

1. Redux/React-Redux-Toolkit
Purpose: Manages global state efficiently.
How It Helps:
Simplifies state management in complex applications.
Provides tools like createSlice and createAsyncThunk to reduce boilerplate code.
Ensures predictable state updates.
2. React-Router-Dom
Purpose: Enables navigation and routing in React applications.
How It Helps:
Makes it easy to create multi-page apps with dynamic navigation.
Handles URL-based navigation without reloading the page.
Supports route parameters for dynamic content.
3. Appwrite
Purpose: A backend-as-a-service (BaaS) for managing authentication, databases, and more.
How It Helps:
Provides ready-to-use APIs for user authentication, file storage, and database operations.
Speeds up backend development by eliminating the need to build it from scratch.
Enhances security with built-in authentication mechanisms.
4. React-Hook-Form
Purpose: Simplifies form handling in React.
How It Helps:
Minimizes re-renders and improves form performance.
Provides easy-to-use validation and error-handling features.
Reduces code complexity compared to traditional form handling.
5. html-react-parser
Purpose: Parses and renders HTML strings as React components.
How It Helps:
Dynamically displays HTML content fetched from APIs or databases.
Safely renders HTML while avoiding issues like XSS (cross-site scripting).
6. @tinymce/tinymce-react
Purpose: Integrates the TinyMCE rich-text editor into React.
How It Helps:
Adds a full-featured text editor for creating or editing content.
Allows users to format text, add images, and manage other rich-text content.
7. Tailwind CSS
Purpose: A utility-first CSS framework.
How It Helps:
Speeds up styling with pre-designed utility classes.
Reduces the need for writing custom CSS.
Makes it easier to create responsive and visually consistent designs.
How These Libraries Work Together
State Management: Redux manages application-wide state, ensuring data consistency.
Navigation: React-Router-Dom provides smooth transitions between pages.
Backend: Appwrite handles backend services like authentication and data storage.
Forms: React-Hook-Form makes handling user input and validation seamless.
Rich Text: TinyMCE allows users to create or edit formatted content dynamically.
Dynamic Rendering: html-react-parser ensures HTML content from APIs is rendered correctly.
Styling: Tailwind CSS helps build a clean, responsive UI quickly.
